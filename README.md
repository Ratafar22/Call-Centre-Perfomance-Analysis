![](https://github.com/Ratafar22/Call-Centre-Performance-Analysis/blob/main/Call-Centre-Image.jpg)

## Introduction
In this project, I dived into the world of customer service and analysed the performance of a Call Centre. This project aims to assess how well the company is doing in terms of the services provided to its customers and to gain insights into how the customers perceive the business.

## Problem Statement:
Below are the questions this analysis tends to answer.
1.	What is the total number of calls received across the various call centres?
2.	On average how much time do customers spend on a call?
3.	What are the reasons for the call?
4.	How satisfied are the customers with our services?
5.	Which of our channels do customers prefer to use?
6.	How do the customers perceive our business?

## Tools Used:
Microsoft Power BI

## Skills Demonstrated:
-	Data Manipulation
-	Dax Functions used (SUM, COUNT, IF, VAR, MINX, MAXX, CONCATENATEX, FILTER, CALCULATE, ADDCOLUMNS).
-	Use of Advanced KPIs metrics
-	Used Advanced Filters/Slicers

## Data Source:
The dataset used is #RWFD gotten from [here](https://data.world/markbradbourne/rwfd-real-world-fake-data/workspace/file?filename=Call+Center.csv)

## Data Transformation:
A new column was created to sort and order the variables in the sentiment column for easy analysis.

## Insights and Recommendation

Insights and Recommendations
-	The total number of calls received throughout October 2020 is 32,491 with the highest call (1,170) received on October 22nd.
-	On average, the duration spent on each call is 25 minutes across all call centres. This seems too long compared to the global industry standard which is between 4 and 5 minutes.
-	At 5,570, Monday has the highest number of calls and Wednesday accounted for the lowest number of calls at 4,296.
-	On a scale of 1-10, 10 being the highest, the customer satisfaction score obtained is 5.5 (55%) of the total score, this is above average but according to the industry standard, a score of 75% and above is the best. 
The call centre should provide top-notch services to their customers to help increase their customers' satisfaction level because the more satisfied the customers are, the higher the retention rate which thereby reduces the loss of customers.
-	Based on channels used, at 10,639, call centre received the highest number of calls followed by Chatbot and Email while the lowest number of calls was received through the web. This implies that customers likely prefer speaking directly with humans to resolve their issues quickly rather than using other channels.
-	A larger percentage of the customers have negative sentiments about the call centre services, while a moderate number of them are neutral and a lower percentage have positive sentiments about the services provided. 
The call centre should work on getting high positive sentiments from the customers because this is critical to the success of the business as customers who perceive the business positively would likely recommend it to others.
-	The reasons for customersâ€™ calls were majorly because of billing questions which accounted for 71% of the total calls. The remaining 29% is shared between Payments and Service outages.
-	75% of the Standard Level Agreement was met. This is a very good number, but it can also be improved to meet the industry standard which is pegged at 80%.
