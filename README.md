## Introduction
In this project, I dived into the world of customer service and analysed the performance of a Call Centre. This project aims to assess how well the company is doing in terms of the services provided to its customers and to gain insights into how the customers perceive the business.

## Problem Statement:
Below are the questions this analysis tends to answer.
1.	What is the total number of calls received across the various call centres?
2.	On average how much time do customers spend on a call?
3.	What are the reasons for the call?
4.	How satisfied are the customers with our services?
5.	Which of our channels do customers prefer to use?
6.	How do the customers perceive our business?

## Tools Used:
Microsoft Power BI

## Skills Demonstrated:
-	Data Manipulation
-	Dax Functions used (SUM, COUNT, IF, VAR, MINX, MAXX, CONCATENATEX, FILTER, CALCULATE, ADDCOLUMNS).
-	Use of Advanced KPIs metrics
-	Used Advanced Filters/Slicers

## Data Source:
